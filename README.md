This is a simple calendar application that allows users to manage their daily schedule effectively. Users can add important events to a daily planner, view timeblocks for standard business hours, and save events locally.

## Features
Current Day Display:

The application displays the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner.
Timeblocks:

Timeblocks for standard business hours are presented to the user as they scroll down the page.
Colour-coded Timeblocks:

Each timeblock is colour-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future, making it easy for users to identify the current status of each hour.
Event Entry:

Users can click on a timeblock to enter an event for that specific hour.
Save Events:

The application allows users to save their entered events by clicking the save button within each timeblock.
